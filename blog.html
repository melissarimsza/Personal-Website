            When I was assigned to create an iOS mobile application which utilizes the built in XCode13 camera and photo library API I knew exactly what I wanted to make. I had just finished watching the iconic televeion show "Silicon Valley", a story about develoeprs in the iconic southern region of California. I remembered in the show that one of the characters attempted to create a food classification app, but failed, and instead made an app that could only classify in the binary: Hotdog or Not Hotdog. It was a solid concept, something that I thought was achievable, and most importanly, a project I knew I would enjoy working on.

            I began the prohect by conducting research. I learned that Apple has its own framework for creating machine learning models called CoreML. I installed it on my computer and quickly got to work. I collected images of hotdogs and a collection of other objects which I classified as Not Hotdog. Once I got the model figured out I got to work on the interface of the app. I found that there was lots of great of informaiton on the internet about how to access the camera and photo library applications on iOS devices. When it came time to implement the model Is truggked quite a bit. Although the model worked great in testing I couldn't get it to work on the application. After struggling for awhile I decided I needed to try something else. I learned that Apple has its own open source image classifer called MobileNetV2. Lucky for me, one of the classes was able to identify hotdogs! As I implemented the model I realized I needed to make a few changes to the app to get it to work, but in the end I had a great product.

            I am excited to anounce that this summer I will be moving to Boston, Masachusettes to intern with Keysight! I applied for the role all the way back in december. In February one of the managers from the company reahced out to me and set up an interview. In total I had two interviews with two people from the Keysight team. Both interviews went great and I really enjoyed getting to hear about the position and meet some of the team. I am looking forward to working in this role and learning all about Quantum Computing!

            I am also excited to travel and escape the Arizona summer heat. I have heard great things about Boston (espcially Boston in the summer), and I am looking forward to exploring the city.

            This semester I am taking a myriad of interesting classes, one of which is titled Machine Learning for Media Arts. Going into this class I had no idea what to expect. I knew little to nothing about machine learning and there was barely any information on the class. Regardless, I decided to take a chance and sign up for the class. And I am so glad I did!

            The content so far has been extremly interesting. We have learned about all kinds of topics surrounding machine learning such as nueral nets, k-nearest neighbors, and markov chains.

            By far my favorite part of the class has been getting to experiment with all the different machine learning tools available. I had no idea there were so many  cool toolkits and websites that allow you tp jump right in to using and implementing machine learning without too much experience. Each day we learn about a new tool and then spend some time creating content with it. So far my favorite thing to use is deep dream teachnology. I can't wait to see what we learn next!
